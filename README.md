### 👋 Hi, I'm Robert Davies, somtimes Bob. 

I'm a mathematician and geophysicist, currently working to forge a career in data science. This GitHub page should moslty be a portfolio to showcase some of my work.

After 6 years data processing as a seismic processing geophysicist I enrolled in a three month, [full time data science course with General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive/london?ga_campaign=immersive-remote&ga_variation=dsi-tile). I've loved getting to grips with the many different faces of machine learning and working to apply them to interesting problems. Parallels between seismic data processing and data science have been frequent and reasssuring as I look to bring previous experience into future roles.

Outside of work, I enjoy...

⚽ Playing football and watching Everton FC  - not always truly enjoyable <br>
🏔️ Mountains - hiking or skiing, I'd choose mountains over a beach any day <br>
📚 Reading - top books of 2021 were 'A Gentleman In Moscow' by Amor Towles and 'Factfullness' by Hans Rosling <br>
